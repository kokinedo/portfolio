## The Evolution of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering has evolved from simple instruction writing to a sophisticated discipline requiring deep understanding of language model behavior, cognitive patterns, and systematic optimization techniques.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning

### Basic Chain-of-Thought

Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning by encouraging step-by-step thinking.

Solve this step by step:

Problem: A company has 240 employees. 30% work remotely, 
45% work in the office, and the rest work hybrid. 
How many employees work hybrid?

Solution:
Step 1: Calculate remote workers
Remote workers = 240 × 30% = 240 × 0.30 = 72 employees

Step 2: Calculate office workers  
Office workers = 240 × 45% = 240 × 0.45 = 108 employees

Step 3: Calculate hybrid workers
Hybrid workers = Total - Remote - Office
Hybrid workers = 240 - 72 - 108 = 60 employees

Therefore, 60 employees work hybrid.

Now solve this problem: {new_problem}
